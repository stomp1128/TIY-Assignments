            //    name. Open the Apple Documentation and go to the page for NSString. There is a section in the left called "Dividing
            //    Strings". You should be able to find a method that allows you to break up a string using a delimiter. In our case,

            //    name of the agent that logged in. Perhaps you could use the text in the textfield to get the agent's last name.
            //    How would you inject that last name into the paragraph of the mission briefing?
            //    Set the textview text property to the paragraph in "MissionBriefing.txt"

//Question 1

//Multiples of 3 and 5

//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000

var total = 0
for number in naturalNumbers

        total += number
    }

//Question 2

//Largest Palindrome Product

//A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
